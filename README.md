# Order item component

A component to display and modify orders, created using Vue3. 

Deployed on github pages for easy viewing: [mothugget.github.io/OrderItem/](https://mothugget.github.io/OrderItem/)

## Mock data

The mock data was created using chatGPT. I felt this is the sort of task at which chatGPT is ideal to use as a time saving tool. The prompts used are in the planning section. The data were then hard coded in the ObjectList component. The "self contained" part of the instructions ("Self-contained single-file Vue component with mock datasets ORDER_LIST and PRODUCT_LIST") confused me, but  this is how I interpereted them, finally.
 
## Diagrams 

The diagrams in the planning section were created in the draw.io extension for VSCode. I exported them as png for hassle free viewing. [link: Draw.IO extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio)
